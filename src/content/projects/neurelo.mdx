## Product Design

<div class="narrative max-w-2xl mx-auto">

### Setting the foundation

When I joined, the product had a few engineer-built screens and no design direction. I'd never designed for databases before, so I learned the domain from scratch, which helped me spot friction that people closer to the space stopped noticing. Redesigned the onboarding from 12 steps to 4. Shipped the full product redesign in 8 weeks.

## Design System

<div class="narrative max-w-2xl mx-auto">

### Tokens, theming, and getting buy-in

Built a token-based design system with 60+ components and a theming architecture. Presented the approach to engineering to get buy-in. Dark mode shipped as a theme swap, not a rebuild. What would have taken weeks took less than a day.

## Website

<div class="narrative max-w-2xl mx-auto">

### From product to launch

Shifted to go-to-market: designed and developed multiple iterations of the marketing site, landing pages, ads, and video assets. Ran the entire Product Hunt launch solo. Placed 2nd Product of the Day.

## Neurelo Connect

<div class="narrative max-w-2xl mx-auto">

The company pivoted to Neurelo Connect, a data proxy with an MCP server for AI agents. Smaller team, tight timeline. I took on a broader role across product, marketing, and outreach. Concept to working beta in under 10 weeks.
