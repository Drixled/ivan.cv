Developers setting up database APIs do it manually — writing docs, configuring endpoints, managing schemas, setting policies. Neurelo automates all of it.

My job: make a deeply technical platform feel approachable without dumbing it down. I owned product design, design system, brand, marketing site, and emails — everything the user touched.
