## Product Design

<div class="narrative max-w-2xl mx-auto">

### Setting the foundation

When I joined, the product had a few engineer-built screens and no design direction. I'd never designed for databases before, so I learned the domain from scratch, which helped me spot friction that people closer to the space stopped noticing. Redesigned the onboarding from 12 steps to 4. Shipped the full product redesign in 8 weeks.

## Design System

<div class="narrative max-w-2xl mx-auto">

### Tokens, theming, and getting buy-in

The product needed to scale visually without scaling effort. I built a design system around design tokens and a theming architecture, so multiple themes could be supported without rebuilding components.

I presented the token-based approach to the engineering team to build alignment on how it connects to theming and why the upfront investment pays off. Once adopted, it streamlined the design-to-development workflow across the board.

## Go-to-market

<div class="narrative max-w-2xl mx-auto">

### From product to launch

Once the core product was stable, I shifted to go-to-market. I designed and developed multiple iterations of the marketing site, landing pages, ad creatives, and video assets. I also owned the full Product Hunt launch solo: positioning, visuals, copy, and video. Placed 2nd Product of the Day. The marketing site became the primary acquisition channel.

## Neurelo Connect
### The Pivot

The company pivoted to Neurelo Connect, a data proxy with an MCP server for AI agents. Smaller team, tight timeline. I took on a broader role across product, marketing, and outreach. Concept to working beta in under 10 weeks.

## Takeaways
### What it adds up to

Two years. Two products. Every user-facing surface, the design system, brand, marketing, and a solo Product Hunt launch. Then a pivot to a new product with half the team in a completely different domain.
